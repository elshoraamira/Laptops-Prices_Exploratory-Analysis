# Laptops-Prices_Exploratory-Analysis
 Explored Laptops Prices dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. Then I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in the dataset. I used the Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
